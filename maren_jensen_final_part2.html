    <p>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</p>
    <p>Before taking Intro to Programming, I had minimal knowledge of HTML. </p>

    <p>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</p>
    <p>I decided to build my website from scratch in order to get a more in depth perspective of how a website comes
        together from start to finish. There were a couple instances where I would reference other websites to try to
        identify the code that they used for certain features in order to implement it in my own web design. </p>

    <p>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</p>
    <p>Since I did start my website from scratch, I would say the most difficult part was finding ways to tweak the CSS
        to make the portfolio design look more like a standard website. I’m still not entirely happy with the it, but I
        know it is a continuous learning process. I will continue to build my design skills and make adjustments even
        after the quarter is over.</p>

    <p>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </p>
    <p>I am finishing this class with more questions than I had going into it, because I realize how much more there is
        to learn and explore in the realm of web development. I am more motivated to learn JavaScript, and have a better
        idea of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript piece together to form a functional, interactive webpage.</p>

    <p>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</p>
    <p>I would recommend that future students take assignments one step at a time. Learning web development can seem
        overwhelming. There were many times when I first reviewed the code provided for an assignment that I didn’t have
        the a single clue how to begin. Making any small tweaks to the code will help you understand what that line of
        code does, and give you a better sense of how to complete the assignment. </p>
